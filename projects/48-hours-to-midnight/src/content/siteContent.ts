      content: `Dear [MP NAME / MINISTER NAME],

I am writing to you as your constituent in [YOUR CONSTITUENCY] to express my serious concern about the growing threat that bots and AI impersonation pose to our democracy, our children, and our society.

Recent research has revealed alarming statistics:
• Up to 40% of social media accounts may not be human
• During the 2024 UK election, just 10 bot accounts reached 150 million views
• The NSPCC reports an 82% increase in online grooming crimes since 2017
• AI-generated child sexual abuse material rose 380% in 2024
• UK residents lost £11.4 billion to scams in 2024 alone

While the Online Safety Act was an important step forward, it does not adequately address the fundamental problem: we can no longer distinguish humans from machines online.

I am writing to urge you to support legislation requiring:

1. Mandatory human verification (such as periodic CAPTCHA checks) for all accounts posting on social media platforms operating in the UK

2. Clear labelling requirements for all AI-generated content

3. Criminal liability for platforms and AI companies whose products cause harm through impersonation or manipulation

4. A ban on paid algorithmic boosting that allows bad actors to purchase influence

These measures would protect children from AI grooming, defend our democracy from foreign bot interference, and preserve authentic human discourse online.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this further with you or your team.

Yours sincerely,

[YOUR NAME]
